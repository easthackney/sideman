Atmel AVR plus Linux Music Creation project
 -There are TWO parts to this project: 
     1) the C code that runs on the Linux machine (PC or Laptop) ("PC Code").
     2) the PWB containing the Atmel644PA and support logic, along with the C code that
        runs on the Atmel644PA ("AVR Code").
  -development of both the PC Code and the AVR Code are accomplished with the GNU avr tools.
